# Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition-Deep-Learning-

 As part of a course on Deep Learning and Classification Techniques, I developed an automatic number plate recognition system using Python, YOLOv8, and EasyOCR. The model detects and reads license plates from vehicle images in real-time, combining object detection and optical character recognition. This project enhanced my practical understanding of deep learning, computer vision pipelines, and real-world model deployment challenges.
